# Welcome to My Tar
***

## Task
The assignment was to create a simple program in C that works like the built-in tar command, but with limited functionality.

## Description
By doing lots of research and playing around with the built-in tar command, I was able to piece this program together.

## Installation
After compiling using the "make" command in the terminal, one can start using the program for doing simple tar functions.

## Usage
After compiling, one can use the program by typing "./my_tar" followed by options like "-cf" or "-xf" like you would if you were using the built-in tar command.
```
./my_project argument1 argument2
```
